Uploadr.py
==========

UPDATE - This script has been going around for a few years now. My best effor to track it can be at the end of my post at http://joelgil.com/2011/10/uploading-photos-to-flickr-via-command-line-for-n00bs/
Hope this helps anyone out there.

Description
-----------
Uploadr.py is a simple Python script for uploading your photos to Flickr. Unlike
many GUI applications out there, it lends itself to automation; and because it's
free and open source, you can just change it if you don't like it.


Authentication
--------------

To use this application, you need to obtain your own Flickr API key and secret
key. You can apply for keys `on the Flickr website
<http://www.flickr.com/services/api/keys/apply/>`_.

When you have got those keys, you need to set environment variables so that they
can be used by this application. For example, if you use Bash, add the following
lines to your ``$HOME/.bash_profile``::

    export FLICKR_UPLOADR_PY_API_KEY=0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
    export FLICKR_UPLOADR_PY_SECRET=0123456789abcdef
